* Addon Creates and organizes colliders for exporting Static Meshes from Blender to Unreal Engine 4 and 5
* Can create, name, and position your Static Mesh colliders with as little as one or two clicks
* Quicker and simpler than setting up custom colliders inside of Unreal Engine editor.
* Automatically renames colliders for proper Unreal Engine pipeline specs
* Can be used in Edit Mode or Object Mode (currently 'Convex Hull' can only be created in Object Mode)
* Create collisions with as little as one or two clicks
* Fast - Can easily handle thousands of colliders
* Customizable Colors and Shader for better visual organization
* Although fully functional, addon is still a work in progress

Can use all four UE Static Mesh Collider Types:
* Sphere (USP)
* Capsule (UCP)
* Box (UBX or UCX)
* Convex Hull (UCX)

*Tested with Blender 3.6 and 4.0.  You should have a fair understanding of the FBX exporting process and Static Mesh Pipeline before using.*
*See Unreal' official documentation here: https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/fbx-static-mesh-pipeline-in-unreal-engine/*
